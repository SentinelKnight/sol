 You need to configure your node path in the `".xcode.env" file` environment.  You can set it up quickly by running:  `echo export NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node) > .xcode.env`  in the ios folder. This is needed by React Native to work correctly.  We fallback to the DEPRECATED behavior of finding `node`. This will be REMOVED in a future version.  You can read more about this here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#optional-configuring-your-environment
